# lolor Release Notes

## lolor 1.3.0

* Add bidirectional large object migration between native PostgreSQL and lolor storage:
  * `lolor.migrate_from_native()` migrates existing native large objects into lolor storage. This is a manual step (run after `CREATE EXTENSION lolor`) and requires superuser privileges.
  * `lolor.migrate_to_native()` migrates lolor large objects back to native storage.
  * Reverse migration runs automatically on `DROP EXTENSION lolor`, so large objects are never lost when the extension is removed.
  * Migrate from a single writer, then fan out: run `migrate_from_native()` on one node and let the migrated rows replicate to the other nodes (or add nodes afterward). Both the migrated objects and any newly created large objects are then collision-free — new OIDs are node-encoded via `lolor.node`, and generated OIDs are checked against existing rows. Running `migrate_from_native()` independently on more than one already-active node is not supported, because migrated objects preserve their original native OIDs, which lack node-encoding and can collide across nodes.
* Expanded test coverage: TAP tests for dump/restore, streaming and logical replication, and standby promotion; regression tests for `lo_lseek`, `lo_tell`, and `lo_truncate`.
* Security hardening: addressed Codacy/Flawfinder warnings.

## lolor 1.2.2

* Fix lolor upgrades
* Fix issues with pg_upgrade. Note that this fixes upgrades with pg_upgrade going forward. `ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE` for upgrading the extension itself works, so if wanting to run pg_upgrade, first update your extension  to 1.2.2, then run pg_upgrade
* Address CVEs CVE-2022-26520, GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8
* PATH updated to match native Postgres packaging layout
* Make table OID caching safer
